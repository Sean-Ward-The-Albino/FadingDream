                <h2>Focusing on Housing</h2>
                <p>Paert of the American Dream is housing and being able own property. The housing market has skyrocketed in pricing and while interest rates have gone up wages have remained stagent there are soultions to this problem though.</p>

                <p>"The principal federal agency responsible for programs concerned with housing needs, fair housing opportunities, and
                improving and developing U.S. communities."</p>

                    <h2>Observing the problem</h2>
                    <p>We have an angency dedicated to creating housing oppurtunites however the issue seems to be that they do not actually reglate the source of those oppurtunites</p>
                    <p>In america the cost of housing has always gone up however The median price of homes dramaztizally increased from $313,000 to <strong>$475,000</strong> in Q4 of 2022.</p>
                    <p>you can see the data for the market <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS">here</a></p>
                    <p>To understand how we can fix the problem we must obverse where it started. The prices started to alter in 2020.</p>
                    <p>In 2020 there was the covid-19 Pandemic which caused a mass lay off precentage around the country. SO if unemployment has gone up how did the the pricing of houses increase by so much.</p>
                    <p>Investors and coperations would the responible party for this. As Compnaies such as Blackrock and Vanguard starting buying houses and covering thier tracks through media manipulation the got into bidding wars with average familes to aquire homes.</p>
                    <p>The realestae tax code allows for  income that comes from homes is so genorus to land lords that many multi-millionsre investors took the oppurtunity of lower interest meant for middle class families to purchase homes to rent out for increased</p>

            <h2>Applying Structrual Functionlism</h2>
            <p>This approach would try to fix the problem while keeping capailism in tact</p>
            <p>Here's a list of pssible soultions that we could apply to help fix the issue:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not allow corperations or LLCs to purchase homes. This would stop corperations from sweeping the housing market</li>
                <li>Update realastate tax code. disincentive multi-millionares from obtaining new more than a certain number of homes.</li>
                <li>regulate housing costs. Create a limit on how much houses can cost per sqft  and add in varibles to make costs fair but affordable.</li>
                <li>Increase wages so that people can actually aquire downpayments to get their own homes.</li>
            </ul>
